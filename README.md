## Dataset:  samples.json

## Step 1: Plotly
1) Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.

2) Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that     individual.
Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

3)  Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Use otu_ids for the x values.
Use sample_values for the y values.
Use sample_values for the marker size.
Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
Use otu_labels for the text values.

4) Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5) Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6) Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

## Advanced Challenge
Adapt the Gauge Chart from https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/ to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

Modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Deployment
Deploy app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
